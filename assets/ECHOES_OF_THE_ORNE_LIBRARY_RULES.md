# Game Overview ðŸ“š

*Echoes of the Orne Library* is a competitive "deck-building and movement" game for 2-4 players. You are rival academics racing through the shifting, labyrinthine halls of Miskatonic University's most infamous collection. You must build a deck of research notes and navigation skills to physically move your pawn through the library's chambers, searching for the hidden location of the legendary *Pnakotic Manuscript*. The first to find the manuscript and possess the mental fortitude (a powerful hand of cards) to decipher it wins, gaining academic immortality. The others are lost to obscurity, or perhaps, to the library itself.

## Objective

The first player to move their pawn onto the secret location of the *Pnakotic Manuscript* and, on the same turn, play cards from their hand generating **10 or more Insight** wins the game instantly.

## Playable Characters

Before the game begins, each player chooses one of five unique investigators, each with their own starting deck and special abilities that define their path to victory.

### Dr. Alistair Finch, The Antiquarian

> *An emeritus professor of history, Dr. Finch has walked these halls for fifty years. He knows the library's secrets better than the librarians themselves, from its hidden passages to the way the floorboards creak over the forgotten vaults.*

*   **Starting Deck (10 cards):**
    *   6 "Basic Research" (1 Insight)
    *   2 "Cautious Steps" (1 Footwork)
    *   2 "I Know a Shortcut" (Unique Card): Provides 1 Footwork. If you are in a Chamber with a "Locked Door," you may move through it this turn as if it were unlocked.
*   **Special Ability (Passive): "Lay of the Land"**
    > *When you are the first to enter a Hidden Chamber ("?"), you may secretly look at the top two cards of the Location Deck. You choose one to be the location for that Chamber, place it face down, and return the other to the top of the deck.*

### Eleanor Vance, The Prodigy

> *A brilliant graduate student whose mind burns with an unquenchable fire. She absorbs and synthesizes knowledge at a rate that unnerves her professors, building complex theories from the barest scraps of information.*

*   **Starting Deck (10 cards):**
    *   7 "Basic Research" (1 Insight)
    *   3 "Cautious Steps" (1 Footwork)
*   **Special Ability (Once per turn): "Flash of Insight"**
    > *Once per turn, when you purchase a card from The Archive, you may pay 1 extra Insight. If you do, place the newly acquired card on top of your draw deck instead of in your discard pile.*

### Julian Blackwood, The Occultist

> *A controversial scholar who believes that true understanding of the abyss requires one to gaze into it. He willingly courts madness, believing the whispers from the void are not a curse, but a source of profound, albeit dangerous, insight.*

*   **Starting Deck (11 cards):**
    *   6 "Basic Research" (1 Insight)
    *   4 "Cautious Steps" (1 Footwork)
    *   Starts with one "Whispers of Madness: Dread" card already in his discard pile.
*   **Special Ability (Passive): "Whispers in the Dark"**
    > *You are immune to the negative effects of "Amnesia" and "Paranoia" cards. Furthermore, when you play any "Whispers of Madness" card from your hand, you may use it to generate either 1 Insight or 1 Footwork.*

### Mr. Silas Croft, The Head Archivist

> *Silent and severe, Mr. Croft is the guardian of the Orne Library's collection. The card catalog is an extension of his own mind, and he can locate, acquire, or "misplace" any text with terrifying efficiency.*

*   **Starting Deck (10 cards):**
    *   6 "Basic Research" (1 Insight)
    *   2 "Cautious Steps" (1 Footwork)
    *   2 "Re-shelve" (Unique Card): Provides 1 Insight. You may trash a card from your hand.
*   **Special Ability (Once per turn): "Librarian's Prerogative"**
    > *Once per turn, while in the Main Reading Room, you may spend 1 Insight to discard the entire row of 6 cards in The Archive and deal 6 new ones.*

### Adelaide "Addy" Hayes, The Field Explorer

> *Fresh from a harrowing expedition to the Peruvian highlands, Addy is more comfortable with a bullwhip than a book. She is tough, resourceful, and unfazed by the library's unsettling atmosphere, relying on grit and a bit of luck to see her through.*

*   **Starting Deck (10 cards):**
    *   5 "Basic Research" (1 Insight)
    *   5 "Cautious Steps" (1 Footwork)
*   **Special Ability (Passive): "Undaunted"**
    > *Your maximum and starting hand size is 6 cards instead of 5.*

## Detailed Rules & Gameplay

### Game Setup

1.  **Build the Library:** Create the board by shuffling the 12 Chamber Tiles and arranging them in a 3x4 grid. Place the Entrance Hall tile at one end and the Main Reading Room tile at the other, creating a 3x5 grid.
2.  **Prepare the Decks:** Shuffle the Archive Deck, Tome Deck, Whispers of Madness Deck, and Location Deck and place them beside the board.
3.  **Set up The Archive:** Deal the top 6 cards from the Archive Deck face-up in a row next to the board. This is The Archive, the public card market.
4.  **Prepare the Locations:** Count the number of Chamber Tiles with a "?" symbol. Take that many cards from the Location Deck, add the Pnakotic Manuscript card, shuffle these together, and place them face down as the active Location Deck. Return the unused Location cards to the box.
5.  **Player Setup:** Each player chooses a character, takes their corresponding pawn and starting deck, shuffles their deck, and places it face down. All players place their pawns in the Entrance Hall.
6.  **Starting Hand:** Each player draws their starting hand (5 cards, or 6 for Addy Hayes).

### Turn Structure

On your turn, you proceed through three phases:

1.  **Draw Phase**
    At the start of your first turn, you will already have your starting hand. On all subsequent turns, you will draw your hand at the start of the turn. If your draw deck is empty and you need to draw cards, shuffle your discard pile to form a new draw deck, then continue drawing.
2.  **Action Phase**
    This is the core of your turn. You may play any number of cards from your hand in any order you wish. The resources generated by these cards (Insight ðŸ§  and Footwork ðŸ‘Ÿ) are added to a temporary pool for you to spend during this phase. Some cards may provide special abilities, such as drawing more cards or removing a card from your deck. You may use these abilities at any point during your Action Phase.
3.  **End Phase**
    Once you have finished playing cards and spending resources, your turn ends. Place all cards you played this turn, plus any you chose not to play, into your discard pile. Draw a new hand of cards. Your hand is now ready for your next turn. Play passes to the player on your left.

## Key Concepts & Mechanics

### The Resources: Insight & Footwork

*   **Insight (ðŸ§ ):** Represents your research progress and mental acuity. It is primarily used to purchase new, more powerful cards from The Archive.
*   **Footwork (ðŸ‘Ÿ):** Represents your speed and ability to navigate the library. It is spent to move your pawn from one Chamber Tile to another.

### Acquiring New Cards (The Archive)

*   To purchase cards, you must be in the **Main Reading Room**.
*   The cost of a card is listed in its bottom corner. You may buy any number of cards for which you can afford the total Insight cost.
*   Purchased cards are placed in your personal discard pile.
*   Whenever a card is purchased from The Archive's 6-card row, it is immediately replaced with a new card from the top of the Archive Deck.

### Trashing Cards

*   Some card abilities allow you to **trash** a card (usually from your hand or discard pile).
*   A trashed card is removed from the game permanently. Place it in a "trashed" pile or back in the game box.
*   Trashing is a powerful way to remove weak starting cards (like "Basic Research") from your deck, making you more likely to draw your better cards.

### Whispers of Madness

These are harmful cards you are forced to acquire when taking powerful actions, such as claiming a Tome from the Restricted Section. They go into your discard pile like any other card.

*   **Dread:** This card has no text. It does nothing and takes up a valuable slot in your hand, preventing you from drawing a more useful card.
*   **Amnesia:** The card text reads: *"When you draw this card into your hand, you must immediately discard one other card from your hand at random."*
*   **Paranoia:** The card text reads: *"While this card is in your hand, you must play with your hand of cards revealed to all other players."*

### Navigating the Library

*   **Movement:** Moving between adjacent Chamber Tiles costs 1 Footwork. You may not move diagonally.
*   **Locked Doors:** Some paths between tiles may be marked as Locked Doors. These paths are impassable unless you have a card or ability that specifically allows you to move through them.
*   **Main Reading Room:** You must be on this tile to spend Insight to purchase cards from The Archive.
*   **Restricted Section:** If you end your move on this tile, you immediately draw the top card of the Tome Deck. Then, you must take the top card of the Whispers of Madness Deck. Both are placed into your discard pile.
*   **Hidden Chambers ("?"):** When you are the first player to enter a tile with a "?" symbol, you secretly draw the top card from the active Location Deck and look at it. This is now the permanent identity of that Chamber. Place the card face down on the tile to signify it has been revealed. You now have crucial information that other players do not.

### Winning the Game

The game ends immediately when a player fulfills the winning condition:

1.  Move their pawn onto the Chamber Tile that they know to be the location of the **Pnakotic Manuscript**.
2.  On the same turn, play cards from their hand that generate a total of **10 or more Insight**.

As soon as these conditions are met, they declare victory, revealing the Location card to prove it.

*   **Tie-Breaker:** If multiple players could potentially win in the same game round, the player who achieves the victory condition earliest in the turn order is the winner.

## Keyword Glossary

*   **+X Card(s):** Immediately draw X cards from the top of your deck.
*   **+X Action(s):** You may play X additional cards from your hand this turn. By default, you have 1 Action per turn, which allows you to play your first card. Subsequent cards require you to play a card that grants more Actions.
*   **The Archive:** The face-up row of 6 cards available for all players to purchase.
*   **Discard:** To move a card from your hand to your personal discard pile. At the end of your turn, all cards in your hand and in play are discarded.
*   **Footwork (ðŸ‘Ÿ):** The resource used to move your pawn on the board.
*   **Gain:** To take a card and place it in your discard pile. This is typically done when purchasing a card or through a card's effect.
*   **Insight (ðŸ§ ):** The resource used to purchase new cards from The Archive.
*   **Reveal:** To show a card to all other players before returning it to its original location (unless otherwise specified).
*   **Tome:** A unique and powerful card acquired from the Restricted Section.
*   **Trash:** To remove a card from the game permanently. Place it back in the game box. This is the primary way to make your deck more efficient.
*   **Whispers of Madness:** A harmful "curse" card that clutters your deck and may have negative effects.

## Sample Chamber Tiles

The library is constructed from 20 unique tiles, creating a different labyrinth with every game.

### Static Tiles (3 Tiles)

These tiles are in every game and form the library's core.

#### Entrance Hall:

*   *Description:* A cavernous chamber of cold marble and dark, polished wood. Sunlight struggles to pierce the tall, grimy arched windows, and the air is thick with the scent of old paper and dust. Your footsteps echo loudly, a stark intrusion into the oppressive silence.
*   *Effect:* All players start the game here. This tile has no other special effect.

#### Main Reading Room:

*   *Description:* This vast hall is the library's heart, filled with endless rows of oak tables and green-shaded lamps that cast pools of lonely light. The only sounds are the rustle of turning pages and the occasional, hacking cough from a distant corner. The walls are lined with tens of thousands of books, forming a tapestry of mundane knowledge that hides the library's darker truths.
*   *Effect:* You must be on this tile to purchase cards from The Archive.

#### Restricted Section:

*   *Description:* An immense iron gate, cold to the touch, separates this wing from the rest of the library. Beyond it, the shelves are built of a strange, dark metal, and the books are bound in materials that are disturbingly not leather or paper. The air is frigid, and there is a constant, almost sub-audible hum that makes your teeth ache.
*   *Effect:* If you end your move here, gain 1 Tome and 1 Whispers of Madness card.

### Modular Tiles (17 Tiles)

These are shuffled to form the main body of the library.

*   **Periodicals Archive:**
    *Description:* A cramped, dusty basement filled with towering stacks of bound newspapers and magazines. The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, dancing shadows, and the brittle pages flake like autumn leaves at your touch. The stories within chronicle a century of Arkham's strange disappearances and unsolved mysteries.
    *Effect:* When you end your move here, you may pay 1 Insight to draw 1 card.
*   **Microfiche Annex:**
    *Description:* The oppressive heat and monotonous hum of microfiche readers fill this small, windowless room. The air is stale with the smell of hot plastic and overworked machinery. Flicking through the magnified pages of old texts is a dizzying, nauseating experience that strains the eyes and the mind.
    *Effect:* When you enter this tile, you must discard a card.
*   **The Great Hall:**
    *Description:* This chamber is impossibly large, its vaulted ceiling completely lost in darkness far above. Tattered banners bearing unfamiliar crests hang in the stagnant air. Your sense of scale feels wrong here, as if the room itself is a refutation of Euclidean geometry.
    *Effect:* This is a large, central tile, often with many connections. No special effect.
*   **Special Collections:**
    *Description:* Items too valuable or fragile for the main shelves are displayed here in glass cases. You see a shrunken head from the Amazon, a series of bizarrely carved ceremonial daggers, and a star-chart depicting constellations unknown to modern astronomy. A faint shimmer in the air suggests not all the protective wards are purely physical.
    *Effect:* Hidden Chamber ("?").
*   **Cartography Department:**
    *Description:* Rolled maps are crammed into hundreds of cubbyholes, while massive atlases lie open on slanted tables. The maps near the entrance are of familiar lands, but as you go deeper, the coastlines become alien and the names are written in jagged, indecipherable scripts.
    *Effect:* When you end your move here, you gain +1 Footwork on your next turn.
*   **Janitorial Closet:**
    *Description:* The reek of ammonia and damp rot is overpowering. Buckets of black, brackish water line the walls next to cleaning supplies. An old, rope-operated dumbwaiter, clearly not meant for passengers, sits in the corner, its door slightly ajar, revealing a dark, gaping shaft.
    *Effect:* You may spend 3 Footwork to move from this tile to any other "Janitorial Closet" tile in play.
*   **The Orrery:**
    *Description:* A breathtaking, room-sized clockwork model of the solar system dominates this circular chamber. Gears of brass and copper tick and whir softly as strange, unfamiliar planets of polished stone and faceted crystal orbit a central, dimly glowing sphere. Looking at it for too long makes you feel dizzy, as if you're falling into the sky.
    *Effect:* Hidden Chamber ("?").
*   **Manuscript Vault:**
    *Description:* The air in this room is unnaturally cold, dry, and utterly still. Heavy, sound-dampening panels line the walls, and the only feature is a massive, circular steel door, like that of a bank vault, covered in dials and locks that have no visible keyholes.
    *Effect:* Path Feature: All paths leading out of this tile are Locked Doors.
*   **Study Carrels:**
    *Description:* A claustrophobic maze of dark wood and dim lighting. Each carrel is a tiny, three-walled box, filled with graffiti from generations of bored or half-mad students. The sheer monotony of the layout is disorienting, and you keep feeling like youâ€™re passing the same carved initials over and over.
    *Effect:* The cost to move out of this tile is 2 Footwork instead of 1.
*   **Folio Wing:**
    *Description:* The shelves in this wing are built on a larger scale, holding colossal books bound in cracked leather and reinforced with iron. Lifting one feels like sacrilege, and the rustling of their thick, heavy pages sounds like the skittering of some unseen creature in the shadows.
    *Effect:* When you end your move here, you may trash a card from your hand.
*   **Translation Office:**
    *Description:* Desks are littered with half-empty cups of cold coffee, overflowing ashtrays, and reference books bristling with bookmarks. Scraps of paper are pinned to every surface, covered in frantic translations of single words or phrases from unidentifiable languages: "cyclopean," "squamous," "the goat with a thousand young."
    *Effect:* Hidden Chamber ("?").
*   **Binding and Restoration:**
    *Description:* The sharp, cloying smell of chemical adhesives and preservatives hangs heavy in this workshop. Vises, presses, and strange tools for paper and leather repair cover every surface. Half-repaired tomes lie open, their spines flayed and their pages held in place by unsettlingly organic-looking glue.
    *Effect:* When you end your move here, you may pay 2 Insight to trash a "Whispers of Madness" card from your discard pile.
*   **Echoing Stairwell:**
    *Description:* A grand, spiral staircase of wrought iron and dark marble that winds up and down into darkness. There are no landings or doors visible, only the endless, hypnotic curve of the stairs. The sound of your own footsteps seems to come from both above and below you simultaneously.
    *Effect:* No special effect.
*   **Rare Book Room:**
    *Description:* Unlike the rest of the library, this room is well-lit and climate-controlled. The books here are behind glass, illuminated by soft spotlights. It feels safe and orderly, a bastion of conventional knowledge and value, a stark contrast to the esoteric chaos elsewhere.
    *Effect:* When you end your move here, gain 1 Insight.
*   **The Lantern Room:**
    *Description:* High above, a glass-paned cupola allows a single, dramatic shaft of dusty sunlight to pierce the library's gloom. The light illuminates a small circle on the floor, offering a moment of warmth and clarity in the oppressive atmosphere. Itâ€™s a perfect spot to catch one's breath and organize one's thoughts.
    *Effect:* When you end your move here, you may look at the top card of your deck.
*   **Acquisitions Department:**
    *Description:* A chaotic jumble of wooden crates, some stenciled with exotic locations like "Cairo," "Dunwich," or "Port-au-Prince." Many are pried open, spilling excelsior and revealing glimpses of strange idols, clay tablets, or water-damaged books. The air is thick with the smell of foreign dust and dried herbs.
    *Effect:* Hidden Chamber ("?").
*   **Founder's Portrait Gallery:**
    *Description:* A long, narrow hall lined with oil paintings of the university's founders. Each is depicted as a stern, unsmiling patriarch, their faces rendered in heavy, dark oils. There is a disturbing similarity to their eyes, and you can't shake the feeling that they are not merely paint, but are somehow watching you.
    *Effect:* When you enter this tile, name a card. The player to your left must reveal their hand and discard all copies of the named card.
