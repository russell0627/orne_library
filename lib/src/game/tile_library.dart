          'This vast hall is the library\'s heart, filled with endless rows of oak tables and green-shaded lamps that cast pools of lonely light. The only sounds are the rustle of turning pages and the occasional, hacking cough from a distant corner. The walls are lined with tens of thousands of books, forming a tapestry of mundane knowledge that hides the library\'s darker truths.',

          'An immense iron gate, cold to the touch, separates this wing from the rest of the library. Beyond it, the shelves are built of a strange, dark metal, and the books are bound in materials that are disturbingly not leather or paper. The air is frigid, and there is a constant, almost sub-audible hum that makes your teeth ache.',

          'A cramped, dusty basement filled with towering stacks of bound newspapers and magazines. The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, dancing shadows, and the brittle pages flake like autumn leaves at your touch. The stories within chronicle a century of Arkham\'s strange disappearances and unsolved mysteries.',

          'Items too valuable or fragile for the main shelves are displayed here in glass cases. You see a shrunken head from the Amazon, a series of bizarrely carved ceremonial daggers, and a star-chart depicting constellations unknown to modern astronomy. A faint shimmer in the air suggests not all the protective wards are purely physical.',

      description:
          'A breathtaking, room-sized clockwork model of the solar system dominates this circular chamber. Gears of brass and copper tick and whir softly as strange, unfamiliar planets of polished stone and faceted crystal orbit a central, dimly glowing sphere. Looking at it for too long makes you feel dizzy, as if you\'re falling into the sky.',

          'A claustrophobic maze of dark wood and dim lighting. Each carrel is a tiny, three-walled box, filled with graffiti from generations of bored or half-mad students. The sheer monotony of the layout is disorienting, and you keep feeling like youâ€™re passing the same carved initials over and over.',
